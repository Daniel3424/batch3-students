But it is possible to make use of several additional features to improve our classifier. In this learning unit we are going to check how we could use other data extracted from our text data to determine if an e-mail is 'spam' or 'not spam' (also known as ham). We are going to use a very well known Kaggle dataset for spam detection - [Kaggle Spam Collection](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). \n",
